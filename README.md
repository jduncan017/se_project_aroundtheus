#### Plans for Improvement

Some CSS animations to display the cards would be a fun addition. I also think the profile could live in the top right in the header and the "add button" could be moved and made smaller with maybe some other functionality. The site is a little basic and some extra styling could go a long way.

**Description**
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. I added media queries at page size increments to keep the page responsive at all screen sizes. The page looks as desired at all screen widths & heights!
