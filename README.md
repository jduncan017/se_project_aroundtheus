# Project 3: Around The U.S.

## Overview

Around The U.S. is a responsive, interactive web application where users can share, like, and delete cards featuring different U.S. locations. The site is built with semantic HTML5, Flexbox, Grid, and styled according to the Flat BEM methodology. It offers form validation and API integration, using JavaScript classes and OOP principles.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive and provides an optimal user experience on a variety of devices and screen sizes.
- **API Integration:** The application interacts with a backend server for operations like fetching, uploading, and deleting cards.
- **Form Validation:** All forms come with built-in validation using JavaScript.
- **User Authentication:** The image uploads are verified against the user's ID for authenticity and ownership.
- **Duplicate Management:** An option to hide cards with duplicate image URLs helps keep the page clean and uncluttered.
- **Interactive UI:** The application supports pop-up modals which can be closed either using a close button or by clicking outside the pop-up.

## Future Enhancements

- **CSS Animations:** Adding animations for card display could significantly enhance user engagement.
- **UI Improvements:** Shifting the profile to the top right of the header and resizing the "add button" could improve usability. Additional styling would make the site more visually appealing.
